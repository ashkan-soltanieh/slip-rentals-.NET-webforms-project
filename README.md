### Background Information
Inland Marina Ltd, a company operating a marina facility at Inland Lake has asked you to build an application that will handle their leasing services. Inland Lake, one of the largest lakes in the southern US offers a year-round boating paradise. The company is the largest marina on Inland Lake and has the capacity to house 90 boats on three docks.
With recent increases in tourism, the current practice of taking telephone bookings from customers is becoming too much to handle. Automating the process of leasing a slip, a “parking spot” for a boat, will enable the office staff to concentrate on other duties.
In this solution a web-enabled application that allows customers the ability to search for available slips on their docks at Inland Lake. Once a customer is registered in the system, they will be allowed to lease an available slip located on one of their docks.

### Use Cases
1. As a potential customer, I should be able to navigate the website so that I can gain information about the marina.
2. As a potential marina customer, I should be able to see only non-leased slips by a selected dock so that I can make a decision on what slip I would lease once registered.
3. As a potential customer, I should be able to register with the marina so that I can select an available slip for leasing.
4. As a registered customer, I should be able to view all my leases so that I know which slips I have rented before.
